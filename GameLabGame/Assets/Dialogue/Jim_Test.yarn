YOU: Are you out here with anyone?
JIM: Nah, it's my wife's week with the kids.

JIM: Nah, Just pulling your leg!
JIM: Logistic Manager at Hartor. That shipping company.

    YOU: The ones responsible for that huge oil spill in the channel?
    JIM: Yep! Some real heartless asshats work with me.
    JIM: It's a living though.
-> Never heard of them.
    YOU: Can't say I've heard of them before.
    JIM: Consider yourself lucky.
    JIM: I hate working there. 
JIM: They have a quite lenient time-off policy. 
JIM: So I get to be out here once a week or so.
JIM: That's basically the sole reason I stay.
